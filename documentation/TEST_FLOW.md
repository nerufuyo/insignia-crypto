# Complete User Flow Testing Guide

This document provides a comprehensive guide for testing the Crypto Wallet API end-to-end.

## Prerequisites

- API is running on `http://localhost:3000`
- PostgreSQL database is running and connected
- All migrations have been applied

## Test Scenario: Complete User Journey

### 1. User Registration

**Register User 1 (Alice)**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "alice"}'
```

Expected Response (201):
```json
{
  "token": "<64-character-hex-token>"
}
```

Save the token as `ALICE_TOKEN`.

**Register User 2 (Bob)**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "bob"}'
```

Save the token as `BOB_TOKEN`.

**Test Duplicate Username (Should Fail)**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "alice"}'
```

Expected Response (409):
```json
{
  "statusCode": 409,
  "message": "Username already exists"
}
```

### 2. Balance Operations

```

Expected Response (201):
```json
{
  "message": "Top-up successful"
}
```

**Top Up Bob's Balance**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/balance/topup \

```

**Verify Alice's Updated Balance**
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/balance \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ALICE_TOKEN"
```

Expected Response (200):

  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ALICE_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"amount": -100}'
```

Expected Response (400):
```json
{
  "statusCode": 400,
  "message": ["amount must not be less than 0.01"],
  "error": "Bad Request"
}
```

### 3. Transfer Operations

**Transfer from Alice to Bob**

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"to_username": "bob", "amount": 2000}'
```

Expected Response (201):
```json
{
  "message": "Transfer successful"
}
```

  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ALICE_TOKEN"
```

Expected Response (200):
```json
{
  "balance": 8000
}
```

```

Expected Response (404):
```json
{
  "statusCode": 404,
  "message": "User 'nonexistent' not found"
}
```

### 4. Transaction Analytics

**Get Alice's Top Transactions**
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/transactions/user/top \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ALICE_TOKEN"
```

Expected Response (200):
```json
[
  {
    "username": "bob",
    "amount": -2000
  }
]
```

Note: Negative amount indicates a debit (outgoing transfer).

**Get Top Transacting Users**
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/transactions/top-users \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ALICE_TOKEN"
```

Expected Response (200):

}
```

**Test Invalid Token (Should Fail)**
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/balance \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer invalidtoken123"
```

Expected Response (401):

  -H "Authorization: $ALICE_TOKEN"
```

Expected Response (200):
```json
{
  "balance": 8000
}
```

## Automated Testing

### Run Unit Tests
```bash
npm test
```

Expected: All 54 unit tests should pass with 100% coverage on services.

### Run E2E Tests
```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

Expected: All 7 E2E tests should pass.

### Check Test Coverage
```bash
npm test -- --coverage
```

Expected: 
- UserService: 100%
- BalanceService: 100%
- TransferService: 100%
- TransactionService: 100%
- AuthGuard: 100%

## Performance Testing

### Concurrent Transfers Test

Create a test user and attempt concurrent transfers:

```bash
# Register test user
RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "testconcurrent"}')
TEST_TOKEN=$(echo $RESPONSE | jq -r '.token')

# Top up balance
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/balance/topup \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TEST_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"amount": 1000}'

# Attempt concurrent transfers (run these in parallel)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/transfer \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TEST_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"to_username": "alice", "amount": 600}' &

curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/transfer \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TEST_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"to_username": "bob", "amount": 600}' &

wait
```

Expected: One should succeed, one should fail with "Insufficient balance" due to Prisma's transaction isolation.

## Edge Cases

### Decimal Amounts
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/balance/topup \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ALICE_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"amount": 123.45}'
```

Expected: Should work correctly with decimal precision.

### Very Small Amounts
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/balance/topup \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ALICE_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"amount": 0.01}'
```

Expected: Should accept minimum amount.

### Maximum Top-Up Amount
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/balance/topup \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ALICE_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"amount": 10000000}'
```

Expected: Should succeed (max 10M).

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/balance/topup \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ALICE_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"amount": 10000001}'
```

Expected: Should fail (exceeds 10M limit).

## Test Results Summary

✅ **Transfers**: Atomic operations with proper balance checks
✅ **Transaction Analytics**: Correct sorting and aggregation
✅ **Error Handling**: Proper HTTP status codes and error messages
✅ **Edge Cases**: Decimal amounts, concurrency, validation
